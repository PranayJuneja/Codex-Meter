# Changelog

## 2.2.0 — 2026-07-14

### Added

- Configurable reset-credit expiry reminders with multiple custom lead times, per-credit scheduling, reboot restoration, and automatic cancellation after sign-out or redemption (#15).
- A reminder action that opens the existing in-app confirmation before redeeming an expiring reset credit (#15).
- Secure in-app update discovery with daily checks, a dashboard update card, manual checks, and release history (#16).
- Verified APK installation that checks HTTPS trust, file size, SHA-256 integrity, package identity, version code, and signing certificate before handing an update to Android (#16).
- Upgrade recovery that preserves widget providers and options, then repairs existing widgets asynchronously after package replacement (#16).
- An optional live usage monitor showing real five-hour and weekly allowance values in Android 16 Live Updates and compatible Samsung Now Bar surfaces, with a standard notification fallback on earlier Android versions (#18).

### Changed

- The live usage monitor refreshes from new usage snapshots, restores after reboot or app replacement, marks unavailable windows clearly, and stops at the next valid reset or when dismissed, stopped, or signed out (#18).
- Reset-credit expiry reminders revalidate credit state immediately before notifying and coalesce duplicate scheduling state (#15).

### Fixed

- Dashboard usage-card labels now use theme-aware foreground colors and remain readable in dark mode (#19).
- Release-history toolbar and Android back navigation now return through the update flow correctly (#16).
- Expired five-hour usage windows no longer prevent the live monitor from falling back to a future weekly reset (#18).

### Development

- Added a debug-only local release fixture for end-to-end updater testing without weakening production update trust (#16).
- Expanded regression coverage for expiry-reminder planning, release parsing and integrity checks, widget upgrade repair, live-monitor lifecycle, and dark-mode usage labels (#15, #16, #18, #19).

## 2.1.0 — 2026-07-13

### Added

- Optional notifications when five-hour or weekly allowances unexpectedly refill before their scheduled reset (#12).
- An independent notification preference for increases in available reset credits (#12).

### Changed

- Settings now uses an expanded, collapsible One UI toolbar that keeps primary controls within one-hand reach (#9).
- Local-data and privacy details now live in a dedicated Settings section instead of the dashboard (#10).
- Reset-credit observations are coalesced across usage and detail responses to prevent duplicate increase notifications (#12).

### Fixed

- Suppressed false refill celebrations after reset-credit redemption, including delayed backend propagation (#12).

- Cleaned up abandoned OAuth services when onboarding is skipped and hardened callback handling across Android versions (#13).

## 2.0.0 — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Samsung One UI-native dashboard, settings, widget configuration, and About surfaces.
- Responsive ring, four-dial, and battery-list home-screen widget layouts.
- Dedicated five-hour and weekly Samsung lock-screen widget providers.
- Updated adaptive icons, theme assets, previews, opacity controls, and usage wave presentation.
- Gradle wrapper and reproducible Android build configuration with vendored OneUI-Design metadata.

### Changed

- Reworked navigation, account controls, refresh preferences, and notification settings around SESL components.
- Updated widget rendering and sizing to follow the dimensions supplied by Android and One UI hosts.
- Simplified the release build script to use the Gradle Android plugin.

### Fixed

- Prevented the One UI pull-to-refresh indicator from crashing when its four-dot drawable starts.
- Added deduplicated low-usage alerts for both usage windows and notifications when reset-credit inventory increases.
- Decoupled reset-time reminders from the low-usage threshold and added an immediate notification test action.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-07-11

### Added

- Native lock-screen countdowns for the five-hour and weekly reset timestamps.
- Local countdown updates that do not require additional server requests.
- Reset-alert preferences for silent, notification-sound, and alarm-sound delivery.
- Per-limit alert selection and remaining-percentage thresholds.
- Alarm restoration after reboot and application replacement.

### Changed

- Revised Samsung-style lock-screen gauge geometry with a heavier stroke, smaller diameter, lower visual center, and more deliberate bottom gap.
- Reset alerts now trigger a background usage refresh and update all widget surfaces after the scheduled reset time.

### Security and behavior

- Notification permission is requested only when alerts are enabled on Android 13 or later.
- Exact-alarm capability is checked on supported Android versions; the scheduler falls back to an inexact idle-aware alarm when unavailable.
- Signing out cancels pending reset alerts.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-07-11

### Added

- Detailed Codex reset-credit inventory, expiration display, confirmation, and redemption.
- Automatic usage and reset-credit refresh after a successful redemption.
- Both-window, five-hour-only, and weekly-only widget configurations.
- Optional reset-credit count, expiration, and reset action on widgets.

### Changed

- Supersampled lock-screen ring and gauge geometry.
- Native Android text overlays and native bar progress elements for sharper Samsung lock-screen rendering.
- Single-measurement layouts now reclaim unused space.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-11

### Added

- Eight Samsung lock-screen/AOD picker entries: Numbers, Rings, Gauges, and Bars, each in Square (1×1) and Wide (2×1) sizes.
- Dedicated monochrome preview artwork and runtime renderers for every graphic lock-screen style.
- Size-aware lock-screen bitmap rendering using Samsung/Android host-provided `OPTION_APPWIDGET_SIZES` when available.

### Changed

- Preserved the existing square and wide numeric provider component names so installed 1.4.0 tiles remain valid after upgrading.
- Exposed graphic choices as separate provider components rather than relying on a lock-screen host configuration activity that One UI does not consistently surface.
- Extended the optional Samsung ServiceBox compatibility response to all eight style/size combinations.

### Verified

- Compiled and decoded all eight provider and companion metadata resources.
- Restricted lock-screen layouts to RemoteViews-safe `FrameLayout`, `TextView`, and `ImageView` classes.
- Signed with the same certificate as 1.2.0–1.4.0 for direct installation over the previous release.

## 1.4.0

- Replaced the legacy complication-marker provider with current One UI monotone AppWidget metadata and category routing.

### Added

- Switched widget text to Samsung's `sec` family when available, with normal platform fallback elsewhere.
- Version 1.3.0 reuses the 1.2.0 signing certificate and supports in-place installation.

### Fixed

- Removed the default `CODEX` text from picker previews and initial widget layouts.
- Made successful snapshot persistence and refresh-error clearing atomic.
- Suppressed misleading red refresh warnings while a newly fetched snapshot is still current.
- Removed clipped toolbar buttons and inconsistent control minimum heights.

### Added

- Automatic, Large, and Maximum ring/gauge sizing policies.
- Fully transparent widget backgrounds.
- Five- and ten-minute best-effort refresh choices using chained one-shot jobs.
- Separate Material expressive and One UI visual-language choices for the app and each widget.

### Changed
